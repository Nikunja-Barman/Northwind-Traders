Northwind Traders, a global gourmet food distributor, sought to leverage data for improved sales, product management, and operational efficiency. As part of the Maven Analytics Power BI Challenge, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard solution to provide actionable insights from their transactional data.


# Problem Statement/Objective:
The primary objective was to transform Northwind Traders' raw transactional data which consists of multiple tables viz Category, Customer, Date, Employees, Managers, Order_details, Orders, Products, Shippers into a comprehensive business intelligence tool. This involved analyzing sales performance, identifying key product and customer trends, and assessing operational metrics (e.g., order fulfillment, shipping costs) to enable data-driven strategic planning and decision-making for sustainable growth.


# What I did:

Data Acquisition & Transformation: Loaded and transformed raw data using Power Query, ensuring data quality and readiness for analysis.

Data Modeling: Established relationships between various tables (e.g., Orders to Order Details, Products to Categories) to create a robust analytical model. Image of the Data modelling is attached.

DAX Measures Development: Created multiple DAX measures for key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Sales in CY, YoY Sales Growth, Freight Cost, Avg Order Value, CPO (Cost Per Order), On-Time Delivery Rate, Repeat Purchase Rate, and Product Profitability.

Dashboard Design & Visualization: Designed two interconnected, user-friendly, and visually appealing dashboards (Sales Performance Dashboard & Operational Performance Dashboard), incorporating various Power BI visuals to convey insights effectively.

Insights Generation: Analyzed sales trends, product and customer performance, and operational metrics to derive actionable business insights and recommendations.
