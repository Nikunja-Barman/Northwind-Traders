Northwind Traders data model in Power BI strongly represents a Star Schema.

Here's how:

Central Fact Table: orders and order details act as the central fact tables. orders contains the transactional event (the order itself), and order details contains the line-item details of those orders. In a classic star schema, fact tables contain measures (like quantities, amounts) and foreign keys to dimension tables.

Surrounding Dimension Tables: All other tables (products, categories, customers, employees, shippers, Date, managers) are directly connected to the orders or order details fact tables. These are the dimension tables, providing descriptive attributes about the facts.

Direct Relationships: Each dimension table has a single, direct relationship to the fact table. There are no direct relationships between dimension tables that would otherwise characterize a snowflake schema (e.g., products directly linked to categories, which then links to order details). Although in this model products links to order details and products links to categories which is a small deviation towards snowflake, but not enough to disqualify it as a star schema overall.

Key Star Schema characteristics present in this model:

Simplicity: Easy to understand and navigate.
Performance: Optimized for query performance, as data retrieval usually involves joining one fact table with a few dimension tables.
Less Joins: Fewer joins compared to a snowflake schema.
